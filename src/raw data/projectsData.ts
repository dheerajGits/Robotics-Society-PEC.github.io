			'A line follower robot is an autonomous robot designed to follow a pre-defined path, typically a black or white line on a contrasting surface. It uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjust its movement accordingly. The robot continuously reads sensor data and processes it through a microcontroller, which controls the motor speed and direction. Line followers are widely used in automation, robotics competitions, and industrial applications like automated guided vehicles (AGVs). They help in material transportation, warehouse management, and factory automation. Advanced versions use artificial intelligence for better path optimization and obstacle avoidance, enhancing their efficiency.',
